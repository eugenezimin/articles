### Functional, Action, Sequence: 3 Diagram Types for Multi-Dimensional Software Modelling
This article discusses using functional diagrams for high-level system architecture, action diagrams for illustrating process flows and logic, and sequence diagrams for detailing object interactions. Together, these three diagram types enable comprehensive modeling of software systems from multiple perspectives - architectural structure, process workflows, and granular execution logic - supporting documentation, communication, and traceability.
