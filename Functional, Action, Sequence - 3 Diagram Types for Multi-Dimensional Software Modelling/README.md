# Functional, Action, Sequence: 3 Diagram Types for Multi-Dimensional Software Modelling
This article discusses the importance of using three types of diagrams - functional, action, and sequence diagrams - for comprehensive modeling of software systems. Functional diagrams provide a high-level, static structural view by breaking down the system into major functional components. Action diagrams illustrate the dynamic procedural flow through key processes, capturing conditional logic and edge cases. Sequence diagrams take a detailed view to reveal object interactions and data flows during execution of specific scenarios. While functional and action diagrams offer abstracted overviews, sequence diagrams drill down into implementation specifics. Used together, these diagram types enable visualizing software from multiple complementary angles - architecture, workflows, and granular logic. The diagrams support traceability between architectural design and implementation details, aiding in communication, documentation, and shared understanding of complex systems.
