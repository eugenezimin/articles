# Configuring SSH to Access Remote Server
This article provides guidance on configuring SSH (Secure Shell) to securely access a remote server, with a focus on Google Cloud Compute Engine virtual machines. It begins by explaining the importance of SSH for secure remote access and administration. The process of generating SSH key pairs (public and private keys) on the local machine is covered in detail, including selecting appropriate key types like RSA, ECDSA, or Ed25519. The article then discusses how to add the public key to the remote server and disable password-based authentication for enhanced security. Additionally, it explores customizing the SSH client configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`) to simplify connections, set default options, create host aliases, and enable proxying through bastion hosts. By following these steps, users can establish secure, encrypted SSH connections to their Google Cloud virtual machines or other remote servers, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized access attempts.
