# JWT at a Glance

This article provides a comprehensive overview of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and their role in modern authentication and authorization systems. It begins by addressing common misconceptions, particularly the confusion between JWT, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect (OIDC).

The piece first explains traditional session-based authentication, illustrating its workflow and potential scalability issues. It then introduces JWT as an alternative, stateless approach to authentication. The article details the structure of JWTs, consisting of a header, payload, and signature, and explains how these components work together to ensure secure, self-contained tokens.

Key benefits of JWT-based authentication are highlighted, including improved scalability in distributed systems and microservices architectures. The article explains how JWTs eliminate the need for server-side session storage, reducing database load and allowing for easier horizontal scaling.

The piece also covers important JWT-related concepts such as registered claims, public claims, and the significance of token expiration and refreshing. It emphasizes the importance of balancing security (through short-lived tokens) with user experience (using refresh tokens for seamless re-authentication).

Finally, the article touches on the integration of JWT with OAuth 2.0 and OIDC, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of these protocols in future discussions. Throughout, the author uses relatable analogies and clear diagrams to make complex concepts more accessible to readers with varying levels of technical expertise.
