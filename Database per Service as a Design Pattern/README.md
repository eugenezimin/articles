# Database per Service as a Design Pattern
This article explores the Database per Service pattern, a design approach where each microservice owns and manages its dedicated database. It begins by contrasting this model with traditional monolithic architectures, highlighting how shared databases can become bottlenecks for change and scalability. The benefits of separate data ownership are then examined in depth: enhanced development autonomy, allowing teams to evolve schemas and optimize performance without cross-service impact; flexible technology choices, enabling services to use databases best suited to their specific needs; and simplified maintenance and migration processes, where changes can be rolled out incrementally with reduced system-wide risk.

The article emphasizes how encapsulating data access behind well-defined service APIs supports these advantages, making the underlying database an implementation detail invisible to consumers. It also touches on how this pattern facilitates polyglot persistence, improved fault isolation, and more targeted scaling. While acknowledging that challenges exist—such as maintaining data consistency across services—the article positions the Database per Service pattern as a powerful enabler of system adaptability and innovation velocity. It concludes by promising a forthcoming piece on the pattern's drawbacks and implementation complexities.
